# What did I learn?

- Using JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Creating interactive web pages with dynamic content
- Handling user events, such as key presses and mouse events
- Updating the styles of HTML elements with CSS classes and inline styles
- Organizing code into reusable functions and variables
- Writing clean, well-structured code
- Debugging and troubleshooting code
- Using Git and version control to manage code changes
- Deploying the project to a web server or hosting platform, such as GitHub Pages

The primary learning goal of the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project
was to improve my proficiency in using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and
create interactive web pages. By building a digital version of the classic toy,
I was able to practice updating the styles of HTML elements, handling user
events, and dynamically updating the content of the page based on user actions.

Through this project, I also gained experience with organizing my code and
creating reusable functions and variables. By writing clean, well-structured
code, I was able to create a functional and maintainable application.
